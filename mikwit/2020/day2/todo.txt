TODO:

- be able to output an answer
- read input from a file?
    - instead, I could store the data in my code
    - read each data entry in the dataset
    - for each data entry, I need to:
        - get the password policy
        - get the password
        - check the contents of the password to see if they match the policy
        - output/record the password if valid
            - alternatively, just increase valid count, instead of tracking the valid
